# To copy files from remote to local, maintaining file properties and sym-links
# (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v), human-readable (-h):
rsync -ahvz host:file1 /dest/
rsync -ahvz /source host:/dest

# While copying contents of directory:
rsync -ahvz /source/mydir/ /dest/mydir
rsync -ahvz /source/mydir /dest

# To copy files using checksum (-c) rather than time to detect if the file has
# changed. (Useful for validating backups):
rsync -avc <src> <dest>

# To explicitly copy <src> to <dest>
# This command will create /dest/foo if it does not already exist
rsync -auv <src> <dest>

# To copy file from local to remote over ssh with non standard port 1234 to
rsync -avzhe "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p yyyy" me@host:file.txt ~/Desktop/
rsync -avzhe "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p yyyy" ~/Desktop/file.txt me@host:docs

# If you want to remove deleted files from destination:
rsync -avzh --delete /source/mydir/ /dest/mydir
